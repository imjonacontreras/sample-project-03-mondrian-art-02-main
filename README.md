The Mondrian Artwork Project is a simple webpage that pays homage to the iconic abstract artist, Piet Mondrian. Using CSS Grid for layout design, this project aims to replicate Mondrian's famous compositions in a digital format, allowing users to appreciate his distinctive style of geometric abstraction.

## Key Features:
- **Grid Layout:** Utilizing CSS Grid, the webpage organizes elements into a visually striking grid structure, reminiscent of Mondrian's grid-based compositions.
- **Color Palette:** Drawing inspiration from Mondrian's signature color palette of primary colors (red, blue, yellow) and neutrals (white, black), the webpage employs vibrant hues and bold contrasts to capture the essence of his artwork.
